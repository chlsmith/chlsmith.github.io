It's hard to be a hero.   The girls were watching TV in the basement a few minutes ago and ran up screaming that they saw a lizard go into the bathroom.   We've seen one before, so this isn't completely nuts.   I went down there with my 5-year-old, the only one brave enough to chase it, and it's already disappeared into a wall somewhere.

I hope I don't have to hire an exterminator to get rid of these things.   Either way, I'm the hero today!
