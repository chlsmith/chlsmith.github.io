I cannot get into college sports unless I went to the college in question. I just do not understand getting wrapped up with a college team if you haven't gone to school there. The players are all basically kids, they aren't even remotely as good as the pros are, and you can't get into watching a favorite player, as they are all gone in a maximum of four years. 

Plus, for football and basketball anyway, there are about 10 teams that possibly can win the championship annually. Sure, there may be 25 total that could win it, but there are really only around 10.

Big Time Football: Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Texas, Georgia, LSU, USC, Oklahoma, Michigan.
Big Time Basketball: Kentucky, Kansas, UNC, Duke, Villanova, Michigan State, Syracuse, MAYBE Gonzaga.

Any other teams are just going to come and go from the top tier. Even some of these top tier ones aren't good for a year or two, but they will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  

If you are a fan of a team other than those big ones and you didn't go to school at the school, then what are you cheering for?  If you went to, say, Minnesota and have cheered for years, then relish in their record this year, because it won't happen again soon.  If you cheered for Minnesota and you weren't an alum, then just watch the Vikings and skip Saturday football from now on. 

If you cheer for one of the big teams and didn't go to school there, you might still reconsider your life choices. You are supporting a bajillion dollar enterprise that "pays" the players about $100k over four years, at least those on scholarship. A player gets injured and never plays again? He's tossed in the trash like a used jock strap, and another kid comes along to take his place. It is NOT an equitable system to the players. So sleep on that when you buy your Buckeye hat to wear to your U of Cincinnati reunion.
