It's been a few weeks, well, months, since I really have trained for a running race.   My last actual race was the Thanksgiving Day race in Cincinnati last year.   That's hard to believe... not even a 5k since then.

I've still been running, mind you, but only really 2-3 times a week and not very hard.   Today is the start of my new training chapter.   I drove up to the Highlands track and did 8x400s after a warmup and a had a short cooldown afterward.   Felt great.   I'm finally back and hopefully everything goes well for a fall race.

Marathon or half marathon for the fall?   I don't know.   How about just training for the Hudepohl 14k to try to get a PR?   Maybe.   It all depends on how things go....it's a long summer.
