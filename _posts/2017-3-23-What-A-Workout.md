I've been going to the Boot Camp workout at the Y for about 9 months now.   Tuesday and Thursday mornings, lots of reps with either light weights or body weight, plus a lot of cardio thrown in.  The instructor shakes it up pretty regularly, with different exercises and different routines most days.   Todsay, though, was a new high for difficulty.

We had 5 exercises on each wall, and each set of 5 was for a different body area.   One wall for core, one for legs, one for upper body, and one general wall.   There were also 5 cardio stations in the middle of the gym.   You picked a wall to start on, did all 5 exercises there, then did the cardio, then picked a different wall.   Pretty straightforward....20 total exercises plus 5 cardio stations.

We started with 30 reps of each exercise on the walls.   When completed, we had a few minute break, then we started again and "only" did 15 reps, and actually removed 2 of the cardio stations.

Not including the cardio, this is everything I can remember:

LEG WALL:
Walking Lunges
Squat with touching the floor
Toe grab squats
Hamstring curls with a ball
Squat with Alternating Leg Raises

CORE WALL:
Bicycles
Frankenstein Situps
TRX Mountain Climbers
TRX crunches
Leg Raises

RANDOM WALL:
Calf Raises on a step
Bent over rows with a band
Back Raises on a ball
Left and right side standing leg raises

UPPER BODY WALL:
Pushups
Tricep Dips on Bench
Bicep curls with band
Upright Row with band
Tricep raises with a medicine ball

Since I made it through both times, that means I did 45 of each of those within the hour.   Let's just say that I'm feeling it now.  What a workout!
