Microsoft is having a little contest to get people using their new Office application, Sway.   It's a pretty slick little app that I think has a pretty good future.   It's not much different than WordPress in that it gives you an easy way to post things online.   The difference with Sway, though, is that they are making it REALLY easy to do.   Just go to http://sway.com, sign up, and try it yourself.

Here's my Sway I'm putting together for the MS Ignite competition.   Feel free to read it if you wish.
