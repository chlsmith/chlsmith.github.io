I got to accompany my youngest kid to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame Museum and to a tour of Great American Ballpark today.  Aside from the weather, it was a really good time.

The ballpark is a really nice place with lots of neat things to see.   We got to to into the home and visitor dugouts, walk on the dirt part on the track on the field, into the Diamond Club, and through the press box.   All of it was really cool and well kept. The Reds are out of town now, so we didn't accidentally see any players, but I don't know that we would've anyway.   Found out that they mow the field every day when they are in town and every other day when they are out.  Also learned that there is about two miles of piping under the field, so when a rain comes up, the field dries really quickly and the rain is stored in a cistern under the visitor's dugout, so as to be used to water the field later.  

The museum was also pretty fun, too.  Lots of pictures, trophies, and some cool interactive videos.   One was of Pete Rose giving tips on batting.  Another had Billy Hamilton talking about how to get better at base running.
