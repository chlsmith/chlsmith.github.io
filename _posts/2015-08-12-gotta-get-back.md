I gotta get back to posting on here regularly.   It's really nice to have a place to come back to for information on stuff I've figured out.   So much with the random thoughts stuff...I just need a place for notes.

My current discovery is working with PowerShell DSC to get SQL Server installed automatically.   A couple of good links are below.   One is an example using the xSQLps module, and it works really well.   The other is information regarding securing credentials using certificates.   That's the hard part of this, and it's the part I'm still trying to figure out.

More to come when I figure out the cert thing.
