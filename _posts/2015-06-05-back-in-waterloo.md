Back in Waterloo for the 2015 edition of the Trek 100.   Going for 100 miles this year on the Domane tomorrow, so this should be a fun experience.   Right now, though, it's a normal day at work, but I'm at the new Ascend office.   Nice place, as far as big rooms with cubes in it is concerned.

Expect more news tomorrow after my big ride.   Lots of food and beverages, plus I'm riding with Jens Voigt.   Well, not really....he's going to be here for it and I'm sure the poor chumps in the front pack are going to be suffering.   :)
