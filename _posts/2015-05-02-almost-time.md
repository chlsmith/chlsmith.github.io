Leaving tomorrow for my Chicago trip for MS Ignite.   Can't wait to see what Microsoft has in store for us this year.   I have a very full schedule of seminars, plus there's always the vendor floor with all the booths and sales stuff.

A few things I want to see:

1.  Disaster recovery for Azure Iaas systems.

2.  The new Nano Server.

3.  What's coming up with Azure.

4.  Chef fun.

Should be a good way to geek out.
