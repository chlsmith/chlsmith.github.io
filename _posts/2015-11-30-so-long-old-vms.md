Strangely, I've always loved the moment when I can kill off a server that I've been taking care of.   Particularly if it means that I've since moved the services to something better or consolidated them to something else.   I just hate having extra overhead out there....

It's just so satisfying to see something disappear.   Another beauty of virtualization and of the cloud is that I can do this with just a few keystrokes.   No more worry, no more overhead, and no more cost.   Trifecta of relief.
