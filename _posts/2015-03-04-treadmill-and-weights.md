Did something today I haven't done in years.   I ran 3 miles on the treadmill and then used the weights at a real gym.   The treadmill was boring as hell, but at least I wasn't in the cold rain.   The weights actually felt great.   I will be back on them in a day or two, once my arms and chest aren't screaming at me.
