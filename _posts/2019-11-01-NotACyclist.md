It's official: after years of trying and training for and riding in long bike rides, I'm just simply NOT a cyclist.  I don't know why, but I have more mechanical issues than anyone possibly should.  Flat tires.  Broken chains.  Handlebars needing retaped.  I just can't buy a break.

Today, just trying to get my bike on the trainer for the winter.  I have one of those green trainer tires.  I took the real tire off and put the green one on, then started pumping.   I could hear it leaking.  So I started over, took the green one off and just put the original tire back on with a new tube.  Started pumping, and sure as shit, another busted tube.  

I'm taking the wheel in to the shop tonight to get a tube installed and it's going on my trainer permanently.  I'm just done. It is obvious that someone or something is telling me, "Chris, you are not a cyclist."   I'm finally going to listen.
