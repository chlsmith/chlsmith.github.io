# Why move the blog?

It's time to step up my game and have a "real" blog.   I got myself this sweet domain name and Wordpress wants money, so I'm trying out this Github Pages system with Jekyll instead.   
So far, this is looking simple enough, though this markdown language is a little unusual to me.
