Man, is Git confusing to a newbie.  So far, I have had the opportunity to redo my blog posts a couple times and I've lost some of the work I'd put into some test scripts I was writing.   Get things typed up, save it, do what I think is right, and then end up with something in a branch of a fork of something else and just completely hosed.   I just then delete all that mess and start over with a new clone.   

I hope I'm not the only one to do this.  I'm a newbie, so I have to screw up sometimes...better the blog than something really important.  I did find that in VS Code, I can watch the output from my clicks, so now I know more about what I'm doing when I click the menus.  It also explains some of the changes I lost when I rebuilt my computer the other day.  I hadn't pushed what I thought I'd pushed.  Ooops.

Such is my Easter evening.  Three kids watching a Barbie show, wife watching something upstairs on her tablet, and me farting around on the laptop, getting ready to do a little Sunday night work.  Oh, the life of a 40-year-old geeky dad.
