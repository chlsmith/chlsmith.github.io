I'd been having a random issue with my computer for at least the past month.   A couple times per day, a rundll.exe process would spin up and eat about 25% of my CPU.   I tried to figure out where it was coming from, but I couldn't find with with Process Monitor or anything else.   The "image" was inaccessible when I found it in the ProcMon results.   To stop the process, I simply had to kill it from Task Manager, but that was getting old.

Today, I downloaded the Windows 10 Technical Preview to run on my primary work laptop.   This isn't really recommended, since this is for work and all, but I mostly use Outlook, Lync and an RDP connection for everything.   Plus, I still have a VDI machine sitting in the office I can use for everything if I become desperate.

So far, after 10 minutes, it's looking good.   I love how when you reinstall a computer, it seems so darn fast no matter what you had on it before.   This new Start Menu is nice, but I don't have a problem with the Windows 8 Start Menu.   Cortana is neat and looks just like it does on my Windows Phone, so that's a nice added feature.

More to come as I use it more.   Maybe this is the version of Windows that actually replaces Windows 7 all around the world.
