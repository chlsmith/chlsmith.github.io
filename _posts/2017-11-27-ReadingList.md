I'm not really sure why, but my reading list gets bigger and bigger every day.   Lots of good stuff.

I'm working on a sweet history book [Russia: A Short History](https://www.amazon.com/Russia-New-History-Abraham-Ascher/dp/1851686134) that's been really interesting and I'm about half way through.   It's interesting to see how they have, as a nation, struggled with whether they are European or Asian.  There's a lot of influence both from the Slavic side and the Mongolian side...pretty neat.

The problem is, my learning/reading list just keeps getting bigger.   I have a book called [Drive: The Surprising Trube About What Motivates Us](http://amzn.to/2A9OMTm) that I found listed on a bunch of important Agile readings.   Not sure how that'll be, but I think I have an idea of what it's about.  I'm also interested in learning about Kubernetes.   I may not use it on my job at the moment, but it sure seems like I'll need to in my career soon enough.   I'm always up for some book-learnin' on [The Economy](http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/) and this is what looks to be a great free book on it that I intend to get through.   I have a Coursera class on Game Theory that I've started, too, that has been interesting through the first week, but it's been 2 weeks and I haven't started on week 2 yet.  I'm also toying with the idea of working on the Azure RM provider for [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io), which requires me to learn some Go language and mess with some open source excitement.  I'm not sure if I'll do that or not....no matter what anyone says, I'm yet to say that I'm a programmer.

It just piles up.  I don't know that I have a lot of interests, but it sure feels like it sometimes.  I'd ask for more suggestions, but at the moment I'm a little buried.
