Tried out my new Zwift.com account today.  Got my account last week through their beta invite program...I guess I have the gear they want to test with.   I simply downloaded the app, plugged in my USB ANT stick, and started it up.   It found my speed/cadence sensor easily and away I went!

It was fun chasing other animated people on the bike.   I couldn't hear the sound from my puny laptop speakers, but it would tell me to "Close the Gap" and things like that, then you get little rewards to unlock stuff.   I'm assuming the "stuff" would be new bikes, new jerseys, and so on, just like the old racing games on Nintendo were.   Remember Off Road??

It's not as fun as riding outdoors, but it beats just listening to music and riding the trainer.
