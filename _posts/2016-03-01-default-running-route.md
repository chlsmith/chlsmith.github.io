As I just moved about two months ago, I have been figuring out my standard running routes.   I think I found the ideal little 4 miler today.   A few little rolling hills, a couple long flat sections, and a downhill to finish.  Lets me at least believe that I've sped up through the whole route, since it ends up on a downhill.   That's good for the psyche.

Another cool part is that in this little town, you pretty well have to be able to drop a 5-miler or you won't fit in. There are a ton of runners here.   On a nice day, this route takes you right through the sections where you're most likely to see smiling suburbanites trying to stay in wine drinking shape.  Just smile, wave, and keep running...
