Took a little long weekend vacation with the family last week. We drove over to St. Louis to spend a couple days doing The Arch and other things.   Of everything we did, though, the City Museum was the best.

It's a big, modern art facility where artists have apparently salvaged things from buildings all around and welded them together to build crazy stuff.   It not only looks neat, though.  You can climb around in it!  Tons of crawling, running, jumping, slides, etc.   Left me sore for two days.  The first thing we came to was this spiral tube going into the ceiling.   I saw a little kid go through, so I tried to get the girls in there, but they freaked out.  I said, "I'll do it!" and I climbed in.   20 minutes later, I was still crawling around in the ceiling looking for the end.  Not easy on the old knees.  Once you are in, you're committed, as there is basically no going back.   

Outside, there's a little airplane up about 30 feet in the air.  You climb some steps to it, and then you can crawl across a tube made of rebar to a big slide.  Yeah, I did that.  Some people got scared, but you're kinda stuck in line.  

They sell beer, too.  Forgot that part.

Go there.  It's totally worth the trip.  We did that, the Arch, the Old Courthouse, and the Anheiser Busch tour. There's tons left that we didn't do, like the zoo, but we ran out of time and I don't think I could walk another step anyway.
