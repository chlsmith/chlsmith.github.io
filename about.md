### Why "Coffee and Pizza"?
Coffee and pizza are two of my favorite things, and it is also a symbol for the late nights IT folks put in all the time. Give a programmer or an infrastructure engineer a pizza and a pot of coffee and he/she will pretty well work all night. Hopefully some of the stuff I spew on this site will help my IT brethren out in this area or give them some ideas on ways they can keep the late nights to a minimum.

### More Information

I'm Chris Smith and I have the job title "DevOps Engineer", for whatever that means.  I work remotely from my home in Ft. Thomas, KY, (just outside of Cincinnati, OH) and you can often find me lurking in the corner at Starbucks, borrowing their Wi-Fi.  I am gratefully employed by [Trek Bicycle](http://www.trekbikes.com), where I help with the [Ascend](http://www.ascendrms.com) point-of-sale software we develop and sell.

I am a married father of three girls.   When I'm not trucking kids to dance classes, piano lessons, or school, my hobbies include [sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) and running more than my hips probably care for. And of course I have a bike, too.
