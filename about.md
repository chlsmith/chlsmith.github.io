### Why "Coffee and Pizza"?
Coffee and pizza are two of my favorite things, and it is also a symbol for the late nights IT folks put in all the time. Give a programmer or an infrastructure engineer a pizza and a pot of coffee and he/she will pretty well work all night. Hopefully some of the stuff I spew on this site will help my IT brethren out in this area or give them some ideas on ways they can keep the late nights to a minimum.  Many of my posts will just be random, too...just because.

### More Information

I live in Ft. Thomas, KY (just outside of Cincinnati, OH) and am a married father of three girls.   When I'm not trucking kids to dance classes, swim team, piano lessons, or school, my hobbies include watching more cricket than any other white American you know and taking random exercise classes at the Y.  

I am gratefully employed by [Fusion Alliance](https://fusionalliance.com) as a DevOps Engineer.  What's that, you say?  My job is to help programmers get their finished software into the systems where people will actually access it.  Part of that is really just uploading the software from some location to its new home.  It also includes making sure those "home" systems are up and working.  And I try to do all of this stuff in an automated, repeatable, very fast way.  Or, as most job descriptions say, I'm the one on the team doing "other duties as assigned."
